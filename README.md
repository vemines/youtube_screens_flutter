## Clone youtube screens with Flutter

PS: Please note that [device_preview]("https://pub.dev/packages/device_preview") maybe not look like real device. If remove it need change some theme, size of widget(\lib\app\shared\constants)

I will code bottom sheet modal and dialog all screen later

I current using Revanced Youtube, so it may not like your YouTube apps
Because it is a lot of settings, so i just write setting widgets

## First run
## please run "flutter pub upgrade web" for make sure upgrade web package based on your flutter sdk version

If you already install make (If window can install thought Nodejs additional tools)
PS: If don't want install make just open make file for cmd
```cmd
make rebuild
```

## regenerate assets

```cmd
make gen
```
