## Clone youtube screens with Flutter

PS: Please note that [device_preview]("https://pub.dev/packages/device_preview") maybe not look like real device. If remove it need change some size of widget, almost in \lib\app\shared\constants

I will code bottom nav all screen and dialog later

I current using Revanced Youtube, so it may not like your YouTube apps
Because it is a lot of settings, so i just write setting widgets

## First run

```cmd
make rebuild
```

## regenerate assets

If you already install make (If window can install thought Nodejs additional tools)
```cmd
